        <h1>Animation: Fisson Theory of the Moon</h1>

        <p class="projP">
            During my graphic arts course, I decided to make this animation for a presentation on moon formation theories 
            and the fission theory stuck out to me. I made this animation to show what the fission theory was and what happened to 
            the earth and moon during it. Using 3ds Max and a video editing software, I modeled and rendered the animation. 
        </p>

        <p class="projP">
           What I learned from my previous encounters with 3D modeling softwares was the difficulty of working with different 
           perspectives and that project of this size is arduous. I improved on my skills of working with 3D modeling softwares 
           as I worked on this project. The animation didn't end up looking like how it did in my head, but I was able to create
           different parts of the simulation with the help of set ideas that it needed to fulfill. The overall experience was 
           fulfilling because I was able to come up with a good end product.

        <p class="projP" style="text-align:center; font-style: italic; font-size: 11pt;"> Main introduction for virtual tour</p>
        <p class="projP"> I, along with my fellow members in the Tech Genius club at my highschool, worked with the Teen Lab at the Shedd Aquarium
            to make a virtual reality tour for the Amazon Rising Exhibit. This project took over a semester and we used a 360 camera 
            to make this work. I spent most of the time with helping with ideation and the organization of the project, and working on 
            the scripts for the commentary in the videos. 
        </p>

        <p class="projP"> I learned a lot about teamwork and how I fit into teamworking situations. There was also some 
            presentations that was done to showcase our project, which helped me become a better public speaker. The overall project helped 
            me build better connections with others and improve upon the skills I had and wanted to develop further.

            Another project I took on with the help of my graphic arts teacher during high school,
            was the branding project for my high school. This project took a year and half to complete. 
            Our client was the principal of the high school and his inputs were the main feedback my team and I got. 
            These logo images above represent some of the work that done during the project using Adobe Illustrator. Colors were a
            crucial component of this project since print and screen colors were different shades of a general color. Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6BHt40odk2JYTFwZHc2SThCREU" target="_blank"> <strong> here </strong> </a>
            to see all the different print and screen logos made for the branding. 
        </p>

        <p class="projP">
            I learned a lot about working with clients and how I can work in team for a project of this size. I learned a lot about 
            graphic design, including its main principles, and the modern world trends in logo design and branding.
