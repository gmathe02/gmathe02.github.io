Assignment #1 - Portfolio
COMP 20: Web Programming 


1. I implemented all the features necessary for the website. This includes 
   having a completed index.html, bio.html, and resume.html pages and a picture 
   of myself in the home page. I had a stylesheet for each of the pages in order
   to make it easier for myself to edit how one page looks like. 

2. I discussed the assignment with Harsh Prajapati and helped answer each
   others questions. 

3. I spent around 5 hours on this assignment and I am looking forward to 
   improving this website after this assignment.
