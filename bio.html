            Hi all! My name is Lawson and here is little bit about me. I was born in India 
            and moved to the live in the U.S. in Des Plaines, Illinois in 2009. I went to school in the area 
            and became more interested in the sciences and math classes, while learning about
            technology that was available to me. In high school, I became more involved in sports and
            clubs, all of which shaped me to be who I am. I was also part of the Schuler Scholar Program, who helped 
            me and gave me many opportunities and tools to succeed in high school and the life after. 
        </p>
        <p> Currently studying at Tufts University, I am majoring 
            in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I currently 
            work for the Tufts Student Teaching Outreach and Mentorship Program (STOMP) 
            as a mentor. In STOMP, I implement and teach engineering curriculum to 
            students in local elementary schools. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My short term goal is to get an internship for the summer in the engineering field and start to 
            do some side projects relating to Mechanical Engineering. My long term goals include graduating 
            as a Mechanical Engineer from Tufts with a Computer Science
            minor and getting an entry level job as a Mechanical Engineer to gain experience in the 
            field. I want to continue learning more about the sciences especially the fields of
            astrophysics and astronomy in order to further my career as a Mechanical Engineer
            working to discover, innovate, and excite.
        </p>
